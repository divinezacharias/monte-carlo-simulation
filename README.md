## Monte Carlo Simulation for NVIDIA Share Price Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook project employs Monte Carlo simulation to forecast NVIDIA’s share price. 
Using historical data, we simulate multiple potential future price paths by modeling stock price movements as a geometric Brownian motion. 
The project involves data collection, preprocessing, running simulations, and visualizing the results to provide insights into the possible range of future share prices. 
This approach helps in understanding potential risks and returns by showcasing various scenarios of NVIDIA’s stock performance.
Monte Carlo Simulation is a powerful statistical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in processes that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. 
In this project, we will apply Monte Carlo Simulation to predict the future price of NVIDIA shares. 
NVIDIA (NVDA) is a major player in the technology sector, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other advanced computing technologies. 
Predicting its stock price involves understanding its historical price movements and applying a probabilistic model to forecast future trends.

## Objectives

1. Understand Historical Data: Analyze the historical share price data of NVIDIA.
2. Apply Monte Carlo Simulation: Generate multiple simulations to predict the future price of NVIDIA shares.
3. Analyze Results: Evaluate the outcomes of the simulations to make informed predictions and risk assessments.

## Data Collection

We will use historical share price data of NVIDIA, which can be obtained from financial data sources like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or other stock market APIs.

## Required Libraries
python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

## Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used.
Libraries: numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, yfinance or pandas_datareader for financial data acquisition.

## Load Historical Data

# Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
ticker = 'NVDA'
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2024-01-01'
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
data.head()

## Data Preparation
# Calculate daily returns
data['Daily Return'] = data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

# Drop missing values
data = data.dropna()
data.head()

## Parameters
Initial Price: Current stock price
Daily Volatility: Standard deviation of daily returns
Number of Simulations: Number of future paths to simulate
Simulation Duration: Number of days to forecast

## Analysis
Forecast Distribution: Analyze the distribution of simulated prices to understand potential future price ranges.
Risk Assessment: Evaluate the probability of different price levels and potential risk factors.

## Visualization:
Plot the simulated price paths to visualize the range of possible future values.
Create histograms and density plots to illustrate the distribution of the simulated prices.
